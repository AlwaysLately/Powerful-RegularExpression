###Powerful Regex
In decent editors, it's common to find that when you type partial strings from the full path and the list of suggestions will be narrowed down to match the desired file.

Examples:
![Sublime Text](https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/1468563/LIitkIbiuCIz5cZH27rLJ0qGkgA/medium_subl-cmd-p.gif)

This is an extremely useful feature and it's quite easy to implement.
